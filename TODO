TODO (sorted by relevance):
- Look into why place matching is so unreliable
- Experiment with OSGTS interface
- Write vignette

DONE:
- Properly implement BKG data caching -> readRDS, writeRDS
- Implement a more flexible way to control string distance methods -> dyn_comparator function
- Include test data (OSM)? -> address dataset of OSM community centers
- Reduce imports (dplyr, magrittr, glue, readr, stringr, openxlsx)
- Experiment with different string distance metrics
