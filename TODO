TODO (sorted by relevance):
- Look at why address matching sometimes does not match even though the address
  exists in the database
- Experiment with OSGTS interface
- Write vignette

DONE:
- Properly implement BKG data caching -> readRDS, writeRDS
- Implement a more flexible way to control string distance methods -> dyn_comparator function
- Include test data (OSM)? -> address dataset of OSM community centers
- Reduce imports (dplyr, magrittr, glue, readr, stringr, openxlsx)
- Experiment with different string distance metrics
- Speed up BKG data I/O (SQL database?) -> No
- Look into why place matching is so unreliable -> Fixed
