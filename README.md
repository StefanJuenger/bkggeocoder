`bkggeocoder` is an R interface to the geocoding services of the [Federal
Agency of Cartography and Geodesy
(BKG)](https://gdz.bkg.bund.de/index.php/default/webanwendungen/bkg-geocoder.html)
in Germany and an offline geocoder based on its raw address data. The package contains two main features:

- `bkg_geocode_offline`: Offline geocoding based on raw address data
- `bkg_geocode`: Online geocoding through the BKG geocoding API
  (`gdz_geokodierung`)

**WARNING**: The routines for geocoding and also the way the data are
provided are still in the process of testing. Please be aware that some
things may change in the future.

## Requirements

Note that the use of BKG address data is restricted. At the very least,
you need to have access to the [BKG geocoding
API](https://gdz.bkg.bund.de/index.php/default/geokodierungsdienst-opensearch-der-adv-fur-adressen-und-geonamen-gdz-geokodierung.html)
to use the online geocoding functions. Additionally, in order to use the
offline geocoding features, access to the raw encrypted BKG data is
required as well as a set of credentials to decrypt the data. Before
installing the package, make sure you fulfill these requirements. In any
case, this repository serves as a means to make geocoding workflows that
make use of this package transparent and reproducible.

When using and publishing the results of the geocoding functions in this
package, always refer to the data source as follows:
